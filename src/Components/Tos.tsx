            <h2>4. Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              The App collects and stores health-related information, including your primary health concern (e.g., a core symptom, illness, or disease) and associated symptoms.
              This data is encrypted and securely stored in an AWS RDS MySQL database. Communication between the server and the database is protected using SSL encryption.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>HIPAA Compliance:</strong> I have taken steps to comply with HIPAA regulations to the best of my ability, including signing a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with AWS.
              However, please be aware that this app is an open-source project developed by a self-taught programmer, and there may be unforeseen issues or gaps in compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
